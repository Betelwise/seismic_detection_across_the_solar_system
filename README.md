## Overview
This project is an onboard seismic event detection system designed to optimize the way planetary landers, such as those on Mars, handle seismic data. Instead of transmitting large volumes of continuous seismic data back to Earth—which is costly, time-consuming, and energy-intensive—our algorithm processes the data directly onboard. It filters out noise, identifies seismic events, and only transmits the most relevant information to Earth.

Our system is a hybrid of traditional seismic analysis techniques and modern machine learning methods. By employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), we ensure accurate event detection while maintaining computational efficiency.

## Features
- **Automatic detection of seismic events**
- **Efficient data processing**
- **Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**
- **Processes a month of data in under 30 seconds**
- **Can work in high noise environment**
- **Tunnable to adapt different mission environments**

## How it Works
1. **Frequency Windowing:** The algorithm analyzes a full day of seismic data at once, automatically finding the best frequency window for isolating potential quakes.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repo.git
